# python-image-grabber
grabs images from reddit using python

this is an update of a script I had working in python 2.7, and since imgur decided that I need to use its api do do anything now I decided to update the whole script

todo:

add support from command line
add support for gui (easygui?)
make sure imgur albums actually work
finish the base code
