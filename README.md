# python-image-grabber
grabs images from reddit using python

This is an update of a script I had working in python 2.7, and since imgur decided that I need to use its api do do anything now I decided to update the whole script

todo:

- add support for gui (easygui?)
- add classes to clean up code
- add support for downloading comics

features:

- commandline functionality
- works with imgur albums
