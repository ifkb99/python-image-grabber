# python-image-grabber
grabs images from reddit using python

This is an update of a script I had working in python 2.7, and since imgur decided that I need to use its api do do anything now I decided to update the whole script

todo:

- add support to use from command line (done)
- add support for gui (easygui?)
- make sure imgur albums actually work
- add classes to clean up code
- ***finish the base code***
